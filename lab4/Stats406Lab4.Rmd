# Introduction to relational databases
- The advantage of using relational databases:

    - Data can be maintained and queried by different threads independently.

    - More efficient queries for objectives that only concerns one subtable.

- Relational database files and their management systems:

    - A .db file is to relational database management systems (SQLite, MySQL, Oracle, etc) as a .pdf file is to PDF readers (Adobe, Foxit, Okular, etc).
    
    - There is one file format (.db) and many tools (management systems) you can use to manage the file.
    
    - Different management systems have very similar syntaxes on basic operations and return queried data in very similar forms. They differ in efficiency and other aspects, but not much grammatically.
    
    - In fact, the commands and even most code lines you learned in this class will run without modification under most management systems.

# Using SQLite in R

- We can work with databases within R by installing related packages.

- Install package RSQLite and connect to a database.

Before you proceed, make sure that you have downloaded [baseball.db](./data/baseball.db), and have navigated to the corrected directory that contains the database!

Solutions to the quizes can be found in this [R-script](./data/Lab4.R).

```{r}
## Load the RSQLite package (install it first if you haven't yet)
# install.packages("RSQLite", dep=TRUE)
library("RSQLite")
## Make sure the file is under the working directory and then connect to it
driver = dbDriver("SQLite")
conn = dbConnect(driver, "baseball.db")
## Check the tables in a database
dbListTables(conn)
## Check the variables in a table
dbListFields(conn, "Teams")
```

# SQL commands

- SQL keywords are not case sensitive, but when calling SQL in R, capitalizing key words helps to improve readability.
- SQL is designed mainly for extracting data from databases, NOT for analyzing them. SQL provides basic summarizing commands and tools, but do not expect too much. We can use R for further analysis.

### Basic SQL commands

The very basic form of SQL queries is:

```
## Pseudo-code 
## Required clauses 
SELECT ColumnNames
FROM TableName
## Optional clauses 
WHERE Conditions
GROUP BY VariableNames HAVING Conditions
ORDER BY VariableNames
```

In **SELECT**:

- **AS** renames the extracted variables for convenience. It is especially useful when a. they are summarized; or b. (will see later) when they have to come with prefixes like table names.
- **AS** can often be omitted. Thus the variable name should NOT contain space (Why?).
- Aggregate functions. For a list, check, for example, [http://www.techonthenet.com/sql_server/functions/index_alpha.php](http://www.techonthenet.com/sql_server/functions/index_alpha.php).

```
## Pseudo-code: SQLite 
SELECT Var1, MIN(Var2) AS MinVar2, AVG(Var3) AS AvgVar3
FROM TableName
```

In **FROM**:

- In this course, unless when combining tables, we only select from one table.

In **WHERE**:

- If there are multiple conditions, they should be connected by logical connectives (**AND**, **OR** and parenthesis when needed). Conditions can also be decorated by other logical operators (**NOT**, etc). For a list of logical operators in SQL, see [http://www.w3resource.com/sql/boolean-operator/sql-boolean-operators.php](http://www.w3resource.com/sql/boolean-operator/sql-boolean-operators.php).

```
## Pseudo-code: SQLite 
## Example from: http://beginner-sql-tutorial.com/sql-logical-operators.htm 
SELECT first_name, last_name, age, games 
FROM student_details 
WHERE age >= 10 AND age <= 15 OR NOT games = 'Football'
```


**Quiz 1:** Extract data from table *Master*. Generate a table with all variables in Master for players born in 1980s and sort by their names.

```
# Solution: see laqsql.R
```

For **GROUP BY**

- **GROUP BY** is used in combination with aggregate functions in **SELECT**.

- (From Wikipedia) **HAVING** modifies **GROUP BY**. It is indispensable because **WHERE** does not allow aggregate functions.

```
## Pseudo-code: SQLite 
## Example from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Having_(SQL) 
SELECT DeptID, SUM(SaleAmount)
FROM Sales
WHERE SaleDate = '01-Jan-2000'
GROUP BY DeptID
HAVING SUM(SaleAmount) > 1000
```

**Quiz 2:** Query data from table *Teams*. Generate a table showing the number of teams that won more than half of the games each year since 1950. Sort by year.

```
# Solution: see Lab4.R
```

## sqltext examples
What do the following sqltext mean? Which one gives you error? What do you expect to see?
```{r}
sqltext = "SELECT salary FROM Salaries
WHERE yearID = 2000
ORDER BY salary DESC"
```


## Inner joining tables

Look at the nice visualization from <https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join_inner.asp>.

Basic form (not quite "basic", careful):

```
## Pseudo-code 
SELECT T1.ColumnNames, T2.ColumnNames
FROM T1 INNER JOIN T2 ON JoiningConditions
## Other clauses 
WHERE Conditions
## etc 
```

- What are the different roles of Table "T1" and Table "T2"?

- **ON**: Specify which rows to combine from the two tables

- In **SELECT** here: specify table names as prefixes for variable names when needed.

**Example:**
```
SELECT Schools.schoolID, schoolName, schoolCity, schoolState, playerID 
FROM Schools INNER JOIN SchoolsPlayers ON Schools.schoolID = SchoolsPlayers.schoolID 
WHERE schoolState = 'MI'
```


- If we omit "Schools" in the first "Schools.schoolID", there will be an error.
- In general, DO NOT omit table names if causing ambiguity.

**Quiz 3:** Join table *Schools* with table *SchoolsPlayers*. Generate a table showing the number of players from each school in Michigan. Sort by the number of players in decreasing order.

```
# Solution: see Labsql.R
```

## Differnt join
**INNER JOIN**: returns rows when there is a match in both tables

```{r}
sqltext = "SELECT salary, Salaries.playerID FROM Salaries 
INNER JOIN Allstar ON Salaries.playerID = Allstar.playerID
WHERE Salaries.yearID = 1985 LIMIT 10"
```

**LEFT JOIN**: returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table
```{r}
sqltext = "SELECT salary, Salaries.playerID FROM Salaries 
LEFT JOIN Allstar ON Salaries.playerID = Allstar.playerID
WHERE Salaries.yearID = 1985 LIMIT 10"
```


**RIGHT JOIN**: returns all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table
```{r}
sqltext = "SELECT salary, Salaries.playerID FROM Salaries 
RIGHT JOIN Allstar ON Salaries.playerID = Allstar.playerID
WHERE Salaries.yearID = 1985 LIMIT 10"
```


**FULL JOIN**: returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables
```{r}
sqltext = "SELECT salary, Salaries.playerID FROM Salaries 
FULL JOIN Allstar ON Salaries.playerID = Allstar.playerID
WHERE Salaries.yearID = 1985 LIMIT 10"
```


**SELF JOIN**: join a table to itself as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement
```{r}
sqltext = "SELECT A.nameLast AS Player1, B.nameLast AS Player2, A.birthCity
FROM Master A, Master B WHERE A.playerID <> B.playerID AND A.birthCity = B.birthCity 
ORDER BY A.birthCity LIMIT 10"
```

# Q&A

#### What's the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`?

See this post here ([http://stackoverflow.com/questions/287474/whats-the-difference-between-having-and-where](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/287474/whats-the-difference-between-having-and-where)).

`HAVING` is used to check conditions after the aggregation takes place.

`WHERE` is used before the aggregation takes place.

In the case of quiz 2 above, it makes no difference (restriction on `yearID` can take place before or after `GROUP BY`). But in the cases where you want you restrict the output by the grouped results, you should stick to `HAVING`.
