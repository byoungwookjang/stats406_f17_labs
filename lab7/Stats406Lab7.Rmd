This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. The lab on regular expression is the same as last year's material that could be found on <http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gaozheng/teaching/stats406/index.html>.

## Some standard R functions for text

Review the R string manipulators:

 - `nchar`: 
    - takes: a character vector
    - returns length of each string.
 - `paste`: 
    - takes a character vector
    - concatenate them.
 - `substr`: 
    - takes a character vector, start (int), and stop (int)
    - extract or replace substrings (inclusively from start to stop).
 - `strsplit`:
    - takes a character vector, seperator (regex)
    - returns a list of subparts split by the seperator.
 - `tolower`: 
    - takes a character vector 
    - convert all upper cases into lower.
 - `toupper`: 
    - takes a character vector
    - convert all lower cases into upper.
 - `sub`: 
    - takes in pattern (regex)
    - replacement (character), and a character vector, replaces the FIRST match with replacement.

## Regular expressions

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a pattern; most characters in the pattern simply "match" themselves in a target string.

We will look at the interactive tutorial here at http://regexr.com/.

### Basics of regex

A plain text string is just a string.

Power of regex comes from the meta-characters. The commonly uesd meta-chatacters are:

`. \ | ( ) [ ] ^ $ { } * + ?`

#### Character classes

 - `.` matches anything (wildcard)
 - `\w` a word (a single character)
 - `\W` not a word
 - `\s` a whitespace
 - `\S` not a whitespace
 - `\d` a digit
 - `\D` not a digit
 - `[aeiou]` is a character set, matches all vowels
 - `[^aeiou]` is a negated character set, matches all but vowels
 - `[a-e]` is a range, same as [abcde]
 
#### Escaped characters

 - `\` is escape character, used when you need character-literals of the meta-characters, or when you use all escaped characters classes, anchors, etc. example: `\+` is literal `+`
 - `\t` tab
 - `\n` new line

#### Anchors

 - `^` is the start of the string
 - `$` is the end of the string
 - `\b` word boundary
 - `\B` not word boundary
 
#### Quantifiers and alternations

 - `|` is the OR operator
 - `{}` is a quantifier, it dictates how many times the preceeding character (group) must occur
     - `{m}` The preceding element or subexpression must occur exactly m times.
     - `{m,n}` The preceding element or subexpression must occur between m and n times, inclusive.
     - `{m,}` The preceding element or subexpression must occur at least m times.
 - `*` means the immediate preceeding character (group) can appear multiple times (including 0 times)
 - `+` means the immediate preceeding character (group) can appear multiple times, but at least once.
 - `?` means the immediate preceeding character (group) can appear 0 or 1 time.

#### Capturing groups

 - `()` is a capture group, can be used to limit the scope
 
 

### An example with R function calls

This was in the news last year ([Barcelona stars snub La Liga awards as Atletico claim FIVE of the big prizes at glamorous ceremony, *Mirror*, 25 Oct 2017](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/barcelona-stars-snub-la-liga-9119612)):

```{r}
txt <- paste("FC Barcelona's stars swerved La Liga's glamorous awards ceremony",
             " on Monday night, despite netting two gongs. Lionel Messi won the",
             " award for best forward while Luis Suarez was chosen as La Liga ",
             "World Player of the Year. But with coach Luis Enrique not even ",
             "nominated for best coach, despite winning the league, no Barca ",
             "players were in attendance even though they were on a day off. ",
             "Atletico Madrid were the story of the night, however, winning five",
             " major awards including best player, best coach, best goalkeeper ",
             "and best defender.",sep = "")
```

Now break into sentences using `strsplit`. Note that `strsplit` also uses regular expression, so you have to include escape sequences!

```{r}
txt = strsplit(txt, split = "\\. ")[[1]]
substr(txt,1,70)
```

Why two `\`'s? Because when passing the string as an argument to `regexpr` in R you have to use the first `\` to escape the second one.

To make sense of this seemingly strange behavior, see [this post on quotes and escaping](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/32260/number-of-backslashes-needed-for-escaping-regex-backslash-on-the-command-line).

I want to find out how many `best` there are in each sentence.

```{r}
pattern <- "best"
```

`grep` returns the indices vector with same length as ”txt” and giving the starting position of the first match or -1 if there is none.

```{r}
grep(pattern,txt)
```

`grepl` returns a logical (match or not for each element of the text).

```{r}
grepl(pattern,txt)
```

`regexpr` returns an integer vector with same length as ”txt” and giving the starting position of the first match or -1 if there is none.

```{r}
regexpr(pattern,txt)
```

`gregexpr` returns a list vector with same length as ”txt” and giving the starting position of EVERY match or -1 if there is none.

```{r}
gregexpr(pattern,txt)
```

What kind of `best`'s are there in the 4th sentence?

```{r}
last.sentence <- txt[4]
best.something <- gregexpr("best \\w+", last.sentence, ignore.case = T)[[1]]

start <- best.something
end <- best.something+attr(best.something,"match.length")-1

substr(rep(last.sentence,length(start)),start,end)
```

`"best \w+"` matches the word `best` as well as the word that follows:

`\w` matches any word character, equivalent to `[A-Za-z0-9_]`, `+` asks regex to repeatedly find such characters as long as it succeeds in doing so.

## Excercise 1: Match multiple strings with one pattern

`pattern` should match the following strings:

 - regular expression
 - regular expressions
 - regex
 - regexp
 - regexes

```{r}
text <- c("regular expression",
          "regular expressions",
          "regex",
          "regexp",
          "regexes")
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
pattern <- "^reg(ular expressions?|ex(p|es)?)$"
```

```{r}
regexpr(pattern, text)
```

## Excercise 2: Validate email patterns

We will try to determine whether an email is valid.

Rather than giving a set of rules to define a valid email address, we will go by examples (from this [post on Microsoft Developer Network](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/testing123/2009/02/06/email-address-test-cases/)):

| Valid Email address |	Reason |
|---------------------|--------|
| `email@domain.com` | Valid email |
| `firstname.lastname@domain.com` | Email contains dot in the address field |
| `email@subdomain.domain.com` |	Email contains dot with subdomain |
| `firstname+lastname@domain.com` |	Plus sign is considered valid character |
| `email@123.123.123.123` |	Domain is valid IP address |
| `1234567890@domain.com` |	Digits in address are valid |
| `email@domain-one.com` |	Dash in domain name is valid |
| `_______@domain.com` |	Underscore in the address field is valid |
| `email@domain.name` |	.name is valid Top Level Domain name |
| `email@domain.co.jp` |	Dot in Top Level Domain name also considered valid (use co.jp as e xample here)|
| `firstname-lastname@domain.com` |	Dash in address field is valid |

| Invalid Email address |	Reason |
|-----------------------|--------|
| `plainaddress` |	Missing @ sign and domain |
| `#@%^%#$@#$@#.com` |	Garbage |
| `@domain.com` |	Missing username |
| `Joe Smith <email@domain.com>` |	Encoded html within email is invalid |
| `email.domain.com` |	Missing @ |
| `email@domain@domain.com` |	Two @ sign |
| `.email@domain.com` |	Leading dot in address is not allowed |
| `用户@域名.com` |	Unicode char as address |
| `email@domain.com (Joe Smith)` |	Text followed email is not allowed |
| `email@domain` |	Missing top level domain (.com/.net/.org/etc) |
| `email@-domain.com` |	Leading dash in front of domain is invalid |
| `email@11.222.333.44444` |	Invalid IP format |
| `email@domain..com` |	Multiple dot in the domain portion is invalid |

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pattern <-
  "^[A-Z0-9_][A-Z0-9._%+-]*@((([A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9-]*\\.)+[A-Z]{2,})|(([0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}))$"
```

The list of examples are typed here for convenience, copy & paste into R:

```{r}
valid.emails <- c(
  "email@domain.com",
  "firstname.lastname@domain.com",
  "email@subdomain.domain.com",
  "firstname+lastname@domain.com",
  "email@123.123.123.123",
  "1234567890@domain.com",
  "email@domain-one.com",
  "_______@domain.com",
  "email@domain.name",
  "email@domain.co.jp",
  "firstname-lastname@domain.com"
  )

regexpr(pattern, valid.emails, ignore.case = T)

invalid.emails <- c(
  "plainaddress",
  "#@%^%#$@#$@#.com",
  "@domain.com",
  "Joe Smith <email@domain.com>",
  "email.domain.com",
  "email@domain@domain.com",
  ".email@domain.com",
  "用户@域名.com",
  "email@domain.com (Joe Smith)",
  "email@domain",
  "email@-domain.com",
  "email@11.222.333.44444",
  "email@domain..com"
  )

regexpr(pattern, invalid.emails, ignore.case = T)

```


## "Now you have two problems!"

It's easy to miss edge cases with regex, care must be exercised.

Sometimes regex isn't the best way to solve a problem. You now know the hammer (regex), that doesn't mean everything becomes a nail.

Use the right tool for problems at hand.
