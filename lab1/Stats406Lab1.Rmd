The lab is outlined from **TutorialsPoint.com**'s R tutorial: <http://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/>
	and **Fall2017** lab: <http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gaozheng/teaching/stats406/index.html>

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Getting started

```{r}
# get working directory
getwd()
# set appropriate working directory (YOUR OWN DIRECTORY)
setwd("C:/Users/Wookie/Google Drive/teaching/stats406/lab1")
# Looking around, list all files under this directory
list.files()
```


## Data types

There are 6 types of basic data types in R:
Logical, Numeric, Integer, Complex, Character, Raw

```{r}
v = TRUE 
print(class(v))
v = 23.5
print(class(v))
v = 2L
print(class(v))
v = 2+5i
print(class(v))
v = "TRUE"
print(class(v))
v = charToRaw("Hello")
print(class(v))
```

## Vectors and Lists

Vectors contains objects of the *same* type. List doesn't require members to be of the same type.

### Vectors
```{r}
# initialize a vector (concatenation)
vector1 = c(1,'A',T,2.3)
# print a vector (works inside functions)
print(vector1)
# another way to display a variable (doesn't work inside functions)
vector1
# another way to initialize a vector
x = 1:10
# yet another way to initialize a vector
x = seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1);x
# you can leave out the paramenter names as long as the orders are correct
x = seq(1,10,1);x
# initialize a variable using existing ones
y = x^2
# Notice that you don't have to write a loop to define y
# R is 'vector-friendly'
# In fact you should AVOID writting loops in R unless necessary
print(y)
```

### Lists
```{r}
# Create a list.
list1 = list(c(2,5,3),21.3,sin)
# Now things inside list1 do NOT get converted to the same type!
print(list1)
```

### Subsetting a vector / list

```{r}
# You can ``access'' any elements of a vector / list by providing its index inside the [ ]
vector1[1]
# Or by providing a vector of indices
vector1[1:3]
# Or by providing a vector of Logicals
index = c(T,F,F,T)
vector1[index]
```

#### Quiz: what happens if the length of the Logical index and the vector disagrees?
```{r,results='hide'}
# vector1[c(T,F,F)]
```


Subsetting a list is **tricky**!

```{r}
# Subsetting a list with [ ], and you still get a list!
list1[1]
class(list1[1])
# To extract the vector, use double [[ ]]
list1[[1]]
class(list1[[1]])
```

## Matrices

Think of them as ``2-D vectors''.

### Creating a matrix
```{r}
M = matrix( c(4,2,6,3,7,1), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
print(M)
# Matrix transpose
t(M)
```

### Naming the columns and rows (always good to have meaningful names)
```{r}
colnames(M) = c('col1','col2','col3')
rownames(M) = c('row1','row2')
M
```

#### Quiz: what happens if the length of the content and the matrix size disagrees?
```{r,results='hide'}
# M = matrix(1:5, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
# print(M)
```

Subsetting of a matrix is siimlar to that of a vector, except you need to provide two indices for the two dimensions:
```{r}
M[2,c(1,3)]
```

### Matrix mutiplication
Dimensions must agree! Vectors are treated by default as column vectors.
```{r}
# with a vector
M%*%c(1,2,3)
# with another matrix
M%*%t(M)
```

#### Quiz: what happens if the orientation is misaligned for the vector?
```{r,results='hide'}
# M%*%t(c(1,2,3))
# What about this?
# t(c(1,2))%*%M
```

## factors
Roughly speaking, storage-wise, an integer array with labels. 

Factors are treated differently from intergers when being operated on. More on this later in the course.
```{r}
# NA does not count as a factor
factor1 = factor(c('apple','orange','apple','apple','orange','pear',NA,'orange'))
# coercion to numerical values produces integer values
as.numeric(factor1)
# read the factor levels
levels(factor1)
# relabel the levels
levels(factor1) = c("cup","bowl","plate")
# look at the factor again
factor1
```


## Dataframes
Data frame is an extension to matrices, allowing columns to take different types.
```{r}
col1 = (1:5)/10; col2 = letters[1:5]; col3 = round(sin(1:5),3);
```
Numerical objects are converted to characters when concatenating A1 to A3, same as when you create a vector of mixed data types.
```{r}
A = cbind(col1 , col2 , col3) # cbind for 'column bind'
print(A)
```
Data frames keep numerical variables numerical, and convert characters to factors.
```{r}
dataframe1 = data.frame(col1 , col2 , col3)
dataframe1
```
Viewing dataframe summaries
```{r}
summary(dataframe1)
```


## [, [[, $, and subset()
It's nice to subset your function through indexing, but what if you want more?
Let's start with the basics

### Single Bracket
```{r}
mydata = iris
colnames(iris)
myvars = c('Sepal.Length', 'Species')
newdata = mydata[myvars]
head(newdata)
```

```{r}
# Grabbing columns 1, 3, 4, 5
head(iris[c(1,3:5)])
```
As you can see, the single bracket 
```{r}
# Grabbing the 3rd~5th columsn from the first row
head(iris[1,3:5])
```

```{r}
# Remove the 1st and 4th column
head(iris[,-c(1, 4)])
```

```{r}
# Look at the first 5 observations
head(iris[1:5,])
```

### Double Bracket
```{r}
# Basic example of double bracket
head(iris[[1]])
iris[[1]][2]

# Let's play with list now
my_list = list(lower=letters[1:4], upper=letters[-1:-20])
my_list[['lower']][1]
my_list['lower'][1]
```
The last example shows that the double brackets are useful to referene elements within a list that has a list.

### which and subset
```{r}
# Look at Setosa iris that has Sepal Length larger than 5
newdata = iris[which(iris$Species=='setosa' & iris$Sepal.Length > 5.0),]
head(newdata)
```


```{r}
# Look at examples that have seplan length larer than 5.5 or smaller than 5.0. We are only interested in Species and Petal.Width
newdata = subset(iris, Sepal.Length >= 5.5 | Sepal.Length < 5.0, 
    select=c(Species, Petal.Width))
head(newdata)
```

## Basic plotting
```{r}
# plot a series against another
plot(x,y)
# connecting the dots, add colors, plotting ranges
plot(x,y,type = 'l',col = 'red', xlim = c(0,11))
```

## Look for variables in environment 
```{r}
# list variables in the environment
ls()
# remove a variable from the environment
rm(list='vector1')
# Now 'vector1' is gone
ls()
## still remember what list.files() does?
```

## Functions

### How to use an existing function from package
```{r}
# look for manual for a function
?rm
# fuzzy search
??remove
```
I find Google search more helpful than ``??''.

### How to define a new function
```{r}
# use 'function' function
f = function(x){
  x^2-2*x+1
}
# last line is returned, you can also use 'return' for clarity
f = function(x){
  return (x^2-2*x+1)
}
# Now apply it
f(x) # works on numericals
# incompatible operation for strings
# f('test') 
```






## Extras
- It is always good to keep in mind that computers are finite machines.
- They are only approxiamtely accurate.
- Your algorithm matters.

E.g.
```{r}
options(digits = 22)
sum(1/1:500000)
sum(1/500000:1)
```

Results are close (for all practical purposes), but bot identical.

## Advanced

[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) is a good reference if you are into the inner workings of R.

## Q&A
My experience has been that study/research as a community is most effective.

I will post questions here for the benefit of all.

Hope we can learn together.

Email me any suggestions.

#### What's the differnce between = and = ?

```{r}
x = 1:11
mean(x = x)
x
mean(x = 2:12)
x
mean(x = 2:12)
x
```

Now what if there are valiables of the same name in further higher environments?

```{r}
x = 1:11

f1 = function(x){
  mean(x = 2:12)
}

f2 = function(x){
  mean(x = 2:12)
}


f3 = function(x){
  mean(x <= 2:12)
}


f1(x)
x

f2(x)
x

f3(x)
x
```

= always creates a binding in the current environment; <= rebinds an existing name in a parent of the current environment.
